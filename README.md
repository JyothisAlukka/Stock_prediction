# Stock_prediction
ðŸš€ Excited to share my STOCK PRICE PREDICTION project using LSTM Neural Networks! ðŸ“ˆ  I built this project using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow/Keras to analyze historical stock data and forecast future price movements.
